## Description
This repository contains the code and documentation for a data analysis case study performed for Bellabeat, a high-tech manufacturer of health-focused products for women. The case study involved analyzing smart device data to gain insight into how consumers are using their smart devices, and using that analysis to guide future marketing strategies for the company. The case study was performed as part of the Google Data Analytics Capstone course, and follows the steps of the data analysis process: Ask, Prepare, Process, Analyze, Share, and Act. The repository includes the case study packet, as well as Jupyter notebooks with the code used for data cleaning, exploration, and analysis. The case study is a portfolio-ready project that demonstrates the knowledge and skills of a junior data analyst.
